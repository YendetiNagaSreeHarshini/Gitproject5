Air pollution refers to any physical, chemical or biological change in the air. It is the contamination of air by harmful gases, dust and smoke which affects plants, animals and humans drastically.<br>

There is a certain percentage of gases present in the atmosphere. An increase or decrease in the composition of these gases is harmful to survival. This imbalance in the gaseous composition has resulted in an increase in earthâ€™s temperature, which is known as global warming.	<br>
	<h3><b>Causes of air pollution:</b></h3>

2)The vehicles which release smokes causes air pollution.<BR>
3)The smoke release from chimneys of factories also causes air pollution.<BR>
4)Waste deposition in landfills produces methane which is a big reason of air pollution.<BR>
